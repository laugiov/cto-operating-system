# CTO 30-60-90 Day Plan

What to do in your first 100 days as CTO.

**Use this when:**
- Starting a new CTO/Head of Engineering role
- Onboarding a new engineering leader
- Resetting after a reorg

---

## The Framework

### Days 1-30: Listen and Learn

**Goal**: Understand the current state without making changes.

#### Week 1: Orientation
- [ ] Meet every direct report 1:1 (30 min each)
- [ ] Review org chart and understand reporting lines
- [ ] Get access to all critical systems (monitoring, code, docs)
- [ ] Identify the top 3 pain points mentioned repeatedly

#### Week 2-3: Deep Dive
- [ ] Shadow on-call rotation for one cycle
- [ ] Read the last 10 postmortems
- [ ] Review last 3 quarters of roadmap vs. delivery
- [ ] Map dependencies between teams

#### Week 4: Synthesize
- [ ] Document findings (not solutions yet)
- [ ] Identify quick wins (< 1 week effort, visible impact)
- [ ] Draft initial hypotheses about systemic issues
- [ ] Share observations with leadership (listen to reactions)

**Output**: Written assessment document, shared with CEO/leadership.

### Assessment Document Outline

Your Day 30 assessment should cover:

1. **Critical path services** - What breaks the business if it fails?
2. **Reliability baseline** - Current SLO/SLI state, incident trends, MTTR
3. **Delivery health** - Deploy frequency, change failure rate, lead time
4. **Security posture** - Open vulnerabilities, compliance status, top risks
5. **Team health** - On-call burden, attrition signals, morale indicators
6. **Technical debt** - Top 5 items by business impact
7. **Recommended bets** - 3 areas of focus for next 6 months

### Metrics to Capture by Day 30

| Metric | What to Find | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| MTTR | Mean time to recovery for incidents | Operational maturity indicator |
| Deploy frequency | How often code reaches production | Delivery velocity signal |
| Change failure rate | % of deploys causing incidents | Quality indicator |
| Error budget remaining | % of SLO budget remaining | Reliability investment needs |
| On-call page rate | Pages per engineer per week | Burnout risk indicator |
| Open critical bugs | P0/P1 bugs older than 30 days | Quality debt signal |

---

### Days 31-60: Quick Wins and Strategy

**Goal**: Build credibility through visible improvements while developing strategy.

#### Week 5-6: Execute Quick Wins
- [ ] Implement 2-3 quick wins identified in month 1
- [ ] Fix one long-standing developer experience pain point
- [ ] Establish or improve incident response process
- [ ] Start weekly engineering newsletter/update

#### Week 7-8: Strategy Development
- [ ] Define engineering principles (max 6)
- [ ] Draft 12-month technical vision
- [ ] Identify top 3 strategic bets
- [ ] Assess team structure against strategy

**Output**: Draft strategy document, engineering principles published.

---

### Days 61-90: Operationalize

**Goal**: Put systems in place for sustainable execution.

#### Week 9-10: Operating Rhythm
- [ ] Establish recurring meetings (see [Operating Rhythm](02-operating-rhythm.md))
- [ ] Define SLOs for critical services (see [SLO Guide](03-slo-sla-error-budgets.md))
- [ ] Implement decision memo process (see [Decision Memos](09-decision-memos-playbook.md))
- [ ] Set up quarterly planning cadence

#### Week 11-12: Team and Hiring
- [ ] Complete initial performance assessment of direct reports
- [ ] Identify hiring needs and open critical roles
- [ ] Address any urgent team structure issues
- [ ] Plan first team offsite or all-hands

**Output**: Operating rhythm established, hiring plan approved.

## Checklist Summary

| Phase | Key Deliverable | Success Metric |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| Days 1-30 | Assessment document | Leadership alignment on findings |
| Days 31-60 | Strategy draft + quick wins | 2+ visible improvements shipped |
| Days 61-90 | Operating rhythm | Cadences running, team aligned |

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It Fails |
|---------|--------------|
| Making big changes in month 1 | Insufficient context, damages trust |
| Skipping 1:1s with ICs | Miss ground truth, seen as out of touch |
| Ignoring quick wins | No credibility when proposing bigger changes |
| Strategy without listening | Rehashing previous failures |
| Changing everything at once | Change fatigue, unclear what worked |

---

## Output

After 90 days, you should have:

1. **Assessment** - Written document of current state
2. **Strategy** - 12-month vision with top 3 bets
3. **Principles** - Published engineering principles
4. **Operating rhythm** - Recurring cadences established
5. **Team plan** - Hiring roadmap and any structural changes identified
