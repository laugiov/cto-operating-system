## What to Look For

### Decision-Making Approach
- [ ] Decisions documented with context, options considered, and rationale
- [ ] Trade-offs explicitly stated (not hidden)
- [ ] Reversibility and risk acknowledged

### Reliability Mindset
- [ ] SLOs and error budgets as prioritization tools
- [ ] Blameless postmortems focused on systems, not people
- [ ] Operational concerns treated as first-class citizens

### Security Integration
- [ ] Security embedded in process, not bolted on
- [ ] Risk acceptance documented and time-bound
- [ ] Governance without bureaucratic overhead

### Innovation Discipline
- [ ] Structured experimentation (hypothesis → test → learn)
- [ ] Clear success criteria and kill conditions
- [ ] Path from experiment to production

## Common Pitfalls Addressed

| Common Pitfall | How This Repo Approaches It |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Vague principles ("we value quality") | Specific, measurable commitments |
| Blame-oriented postmortems | System-focused analysis |
| Security as afterthought | Security integrated by default |
| Innovation theater | Measurable experiments with governance |
| Endless process | Minimal viable governance |
| Vendor lock-in | Tool-agnostic approaches |
