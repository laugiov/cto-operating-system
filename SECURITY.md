# Security Policy

## Overview

This repository contains documentation, templates, and examples for engineering leadership practices. It does not contain executable code or deployed services.

**Context**: Security issues in this repository are typically: malicious links, unsafe guidance in templates, or accidentally committed secrets. This is not a bug bounty program — it's a simple disclosure process for a documentation repository.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Malicious content inadvertently added to templates or examples
- Links redirecting to phishing or malware sites
- Accidentally committed secrets, credentials, or PII
- Content that could mislead readers into insecure practices

### Out of Scope
- Typos or formatting issues (use regular issues)
- Suggestions for additional content (use regular issues)
- Security vulnerabilities in tools mentioned in examples (report to those projects)

## Response Timeline
